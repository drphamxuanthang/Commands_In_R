This Notebook includes the useful commands for descriptive analysis.

We use the mtcars database
```{r}
df <- mtcars
```

Summarize the structure and display the head of dataset
```{r}
str(df)
head(df)
```
A. For continuous variable

1. Measure of Central Tendency: mean, median and mode

```{r}
mean(df$mpg)
median(df$mpg)
  quantile(df$mpg)
  IQR(df$mpg)
library(modeest)
mfv(df$mpg) # C package: modeest
```

2. Measure of variability: range, variance and standard deviation
```{r}
range(df$mpg)
var(df$mpg)
sd(df$mpg)
```
It's also neccessary to visualize the variable in an effective way (histogram, boxplot, bar)

B. For dichotomous variable

C. Introduction to table1 functions (very nice)
